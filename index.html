    <!-- Chosen Palette: "Subtle Earth" - A calm, minimalist palette with a light beige background (#F8F7F4), warm grays for text, and a muted teal accent (#00796B) for active states and highlights. -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application uses a dashboard layout with persistent side navigation to enhance usability for a beginner. A vertical stepper on the left acts as a visual roadmap and primary navigation, constantly orienting the user within the overall learning path. Below it, a timeline chart gives an at-a-glance overview of the time commitment for each phase. The main content area on the right dynamically updates based on the selected phase. This content is further organized into tabs (Overview, Concepts, Resources) to break down information into digestible chunks, preventing cognitive overload and allowing the user to focus on one aspect at a time. This non-linear, dashboard approach is superior to a linear document as it empowers the user to explore at their own pace and easily revisit sections. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        1.  Report Info: Overall timeline estimates for each phase. -> Goal: Compare effort. -> Viz/Presentation: Horizontal Bar Chart (Chart.js/Canvas). -> Interaction: Hover for details, click to navigate to the phase. -> Justification: Provides an immediate, intuitive visual comparison of the duration of each learning phase, which is more effective than a simple table of numbers.
        2.  Report Info: The 6 learning phases. -> Goal: Organize/Navigate. -> Viz/Presentation: Vertical Stepper (HTML/CSS/JS). -> Interaction: Click to select a phase and update the main content view. -> Justification: Visually represents the sequential nature of the learning path, serving as both a progress indicator and the main navigation hub.
        3.  Report Info: Core concepts to master in each phase. -> Goal: Inform/Engage. -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive Checklist (HTML/CSS/JS). -> Interaction: Users can click to toggle a "completed" state, providing a sense of accomplishment and active participation. -> Justification: Transforms passive reading of a list into an active, engaging task, which can improve motivation and retention.
        4.  Report Info: Tables of learning resources. -> Goal: Inform/Organize. -> Viz/Presentation: Responsive HTML Table. -> Interaction: Clickable links. -> Justification: This is the most appropriate and accessible format for presenting structured, tabular data with external links.

                    overview: `This initial phase is about building a solid foundation. Before you can build an app, you need to learn how to "think like a programmer." This means breaking down large problems into small, logical steps. We use Python for this stage because its simple, English-like syntax lets you focus on core programming concepts like variables, loops, and functions, which are universal across almost all languages, including the Dart language you'll use for Flutter.`,

This phase covers creating layouts, adding text and images, handling user input like button taps, and managing the app's "state" (data that changes over time) to create dynamic and interactive UIs.`,
